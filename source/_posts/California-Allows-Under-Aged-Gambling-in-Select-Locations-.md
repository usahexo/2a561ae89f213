#  California Allows Under Aged Gambling in Select Locations 

A recent amendment to the California Penal Code has allowed gambling in some locations for players who are under the age of 21. This has been a hotly contested topic, with some people arguing that it will lead to more underage gambling, while others maintain that this will provide a safe and controlled environment for young people to gamble in.

So far, the results of the amendment have been mixed. There have been reports of minors engaging in illegal gambling activities in areas where it is now legal, while other jurisdictions have set up strict regulations and managed to decrease incidences of underage gambling. It remains to be seen which of these outcomes will prove to be more common.

One benefit of legalizing gambling for those under 21 is that it gives regulators a better way to track and monitor these activities. This can help ensure that minors are not being taken advantage of by unscrupulous casino operators, and also helps protect them from developing problem gambling habits at an early age.

Another potential benefit is that allowing younger people to gamble in controlled environments could actually reduce the overall amount of illegal gambling that takes place. This is because it would give young people an opportunity to experience gambling in a safe and regulated setting, instead of having to take their chances with shady online casinos or underground betting operations.

There are certainly risks associated with underage gambling, but there may also be benefits to be had from legalizing it in select locations. It will be interesting to see how this amendment plays out in California and whether it leads to increased problems or positive outcomes for young people who choose to gamble.

#  Delaware Opens Up Legal Under Aged Gambling Venues 
The state of Delaware has come up with a new and innovative way to raise revenue for the state, and at the same time providing more entertainment opportunities for its citizens – legal under aged gambling venues.

This new program will allow patrons that are 18 years of age or older to bet on casino games, including blackjack, roulette, and slots. In addition, it will also permit those over 21 to drink in the casino lounges.

The hope is that this program will help to bolster tourism in Delaware, as people from other states will be drawn in by the opportunity to gamble legally at a young age. It is also projected to create around 1,000 jobs in the state, and bring in an additional $10 million in tax revenue annually.

Opponents of the measure have voiced concerns about potential increased rates of addiction and problem gambling among the youth population. However, proponents believe that by implementing responsible gaming measures, such as age restrictions and daily betting limits, these risks can be mitigated.

So far the new program has been met with positive feedback from the public, with many people expressing excitement over the prospect of being able to gamble at a younger age. The first venues are set to open their doors in December of this year.

#  Nevada Brings In New Laws Regarding Under Aged Gambling 

In an attempt to keep gambling under control and minors from getting involved, Nevada has brought in a few new laws. 

The first law prohibits those under the age of 21 from playing slot machines or game tables in casinos. This law went into effect on January 1, 2019. The second law also prohibits anyone under the age of 21 from loitering in casino gaming areas, and this law went into effect on July 1, 2019. 

Both of these laws are considered part of the effort by the state to reduce underage gambling. A recent study showed that while the overall amount of money gambled by those 18 and over decreased between 2016 and 2017, the amount of money gambled by those aged 17 to 20 increased during that same time period. 

In response to this increase, lawmakers have been attempting to pass stricter regulations on underage gambling for a few years now. In 2017, a bill was introduced in the Nevada Assembly that would have raised the legal gambling age from 18 to 21, but it did not make it past committee. 

Many casino operators are in favor of these new laws, as they believe they will help reduce underage gambling and create a safer environment for those who are legally able to gamble. Some people, however, feel that these laws are too restrictive and could negatively impact tourism in Nevada. 

What do you think? Do you think that Nevada’s new laws regarding underage gambling are too restrictive or necessary?

#  New Hampshire Opens First State- Run Casino For Under Aged Gamblers 

CONCORD, N.H. — In a historic move, New Hampshire has opened the first state- run casino for underaged gamblers. The new casino is located in Concord, the state's capital, and features dozens of slot machines, blackjack and poker tables, and a full service bar.

The casino is open to New Hampshire residents who are 18 years of age or older. However, residents who are 17 or younger can enter the casino if they are accompanied by an adult.

Governor John Sununu praised the opening of the new casino, calling it a "great addition" to the state's economy. "This casino will create jobs and bring much-needed revenue to our state," he said.

Sununu also noted that the new casino will help keep underaged gamblers away from casinos in other states. "With this casino, our young people can gamble safely and responsibly within their own state," he said.

Not everyone is happy with the opening of the new casino, however. Some local residents worry that it will contribute to increased crime and traffic congestion in Concord. Others object to the fact that underaged gamblers can now gamble legally in New Hampshire.

But despite these objections, the new casino is off to a busy start, with hundreds of people visiting daily since it opened last week.

#  Minnesota legalizes gambling for those under the age of 18

Minnesota has become the latest state to legalize gambling for those under the age of 18, with Governor Tim Walz signing the bill into law on Wednesday. The move comes as a number of states are reconsidering their gambling laws in light of new technologies that have made it easier for minors to gamble.

Supporters of the bill argue that it will help protect young people from addiction, while opponents argue that it will lead to more gambling problems down the line. Minnesota is one of a number of states that have moved to legalize gambling for minors in recent months, following similar measures in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Rhode Island.

Gambling has long been a controversial issue, with some arguing that it should be legalized for all adults while others argue that it should be banned altogether. There is evidence that both sides have a point: while gambling can be addictive and lead to financial problems for some people, it can also be fun and harmless for others.

The new Minnesota law prohibits anyone under the age of 18 from playing poker or any other casino games, but allows them to place bets on sports or horse races. It also allows parents or guardians to allow their children to gamble at casinos and other gaming facilities. Critics argue that this will create an even greater temptation for young people to gamble, but supporters say that it will help keep kids safe by allowing parents to monitor their activities.

So far, there is little evidence that the new laws are having a major impact on gambling behavior among minors. However, it is possible that they could lead to more problems down the line if not properly supervised. For now, it remains to be seen how these new laws will play out in Minnesota and other states moving forward.
