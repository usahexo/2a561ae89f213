There are a few things you can do to increase your chances of winning at 'Video Poker'. One is to study the odds and play accordingly. Another is to find the right game and casino to play at. And finally, you can also increase your chances of winning by playing in the Congo.

The odds for 'Video Poker' vary depending on the game you are playing, but there are general odds that apply to most games. To increase your chances of winning, it's important to understand these odds and play accordingly.

The reason for this is because the Congo has some of the loosest slots in the world. In fact, the average payout percentage in the Congo is an astounding 97%. So, by playing in the Congo, you can significantly increase your chances of walking away a winner.

#  5 Ways to Maximize Your Chances of Winning at 'Video Poker' 

There is no one definitive answer to this question, but there are a few things you can do to increase your chances of winning at video poker. Here are five tips to help you out:

1. Understand the basic rules of the game. The first step to becoming a successful video poker player is understanding how the game works. Familiarize yourself with the different hands and what beats what, as well as the different suits and rankings.

2. Choose wisely when you're deciding which cards to keep. In general, it's always best to keep low pairs (e.g., two eights or two fives) instead of holding on to a high card such as an ace. Remember that you want to end up with the strongest possible hand in order to win money.

3. Bet aggressively when you have a good hand. This goes hand in hand with tip number two - if you've got a good hand, make sure you bet enough money so that the other players have a good chance of losing!

4. Use your wild cards wisely. If you're lucky enough to be playing with wildcards, make sure you use them strategically in order to improve your hand as much as possible. For example, if you have two jacks and one wild card, try and exchange one jack for another wild card in order to create a better poker hand.

5. Stay calm and focused while playing. It can be tempting to get carried away when playing video poker, but it's important to stay calm and think through each decision you make. If you start making rash decisions, it's likely that you'll end up losing money rather than winning it!
