#  Memphis Money Machine: $1,000 for a $10 Bet

There’s a lot of money to be made in Memphis, and you don’t even have to be a professional gambler to do it. You can start making some real money with as little as a $10 investment, and I’m going to show you how.

The key to success in Memphis is to find the right games. The best games are typically found downtown, in places like Beale Street or the Peabody Hotel. But don’t worry if you live outside of Memphis – there are plenty of great casinos scattered throughout the city.

So what are the best games to play? Let’s take a look:

#1 – Blackjack

Blackjack is one of the most popular casino games in the world, and for good reason – it’s easy to learn but offers plenty of opportunity for skilled players to make money. The basic goal is to get closer to 21 than the dealer without going over, and you can use any combination of cards your two hands.

There are a few tips and tricks that can help you improve your blackjack gameplay. For starters, always hit on 16 or less and stand on 17 or more. Double down if you have 11 or more, and always split Aces and 8s. If you follow these simple rules, you’ll give yourself a better chance of winning at blackjack.

#2 – Roulette

Roulette is another classic casino game that’s easy to learn but impossible to master. The basic idea is to bet on a number or color that you think will come up, and then watch the wheel spin until the ball lands in one of the numbered slots. If your number comes up, you win!

There are dozens of different betting options available in roulette, so it’s important to do your research before placing any bets. Some wagers offer better odds than others, so make sure you pick wisely if you want to increase your chances of winning. And remember – always bet on red or black if you want an even chance at winning!

#  Grizzlies Mauler: Win $750 on a $10 Bet

The Memphis Grizzlies have been on a tear lately, and I decided to put my money where my mouth is. I wagered $10 on them to win at home against the Orlando Magic, and they pulled through with a 103-88 victory!

This was a very rewarding experience, as I now have an extra $750 in my pocket. The Grizzlies have now won seven of their last eight games, so it looks like they’re in good form as the playoffs approach.

I’d definitely recommend wagering on them in the future – especially when they’re playing at home. With Marc Gasol, Mike Conley and Zach Randolph leading the way, the Grizzlies are always a formidable opponent.

#  Predicted Memphis Winner Paid Out at Nearly 7 to 1

Ahead of the big game this Sunday, sportsbooks are reporting heavy action on the Memphis Tigers. With good reason – they’re a 10-point underdog, and yet many believe they have a real shot at pulling off the upset. If they do, those who bet on them could be in for a nice payday.

At William Hill US, the payout on a Memphis win is 6.9 to 1. This means that if you bet $100 on the Tigers and they pull off the upset, you’ll walk away with $690. Not bad for a few minutes of work!

Of course, as anyone who’s ever gambled knows, there’s no such thing as a sure thing. So don’t go betting your rent money on Memphis – but if you’ve got some disposable income to play with, it might be worth considering a small wager on this upset special.

#  Grizzly Fans Rejoice as Vegas Sportsbooks Lose Again

The Vegas Golden Knights have been a thorn in the side of sportsbooks since they entered the league as an expansion team last season. And according to reports, bookmakers around the country took another hit on Thursday night when the Golden Knights knocked off the San Jose Sharks in overtime.

The victory not only improved Vegas’ record to 5-1-0 on the season, but it also cost Bay Area bookmakers close to $1 million. That brings the total amount of money lost by Vegas sportsbooks this season to more than $2 million.

Some believe that the books are starting to feel sympathy for the Golden Knights, while others think that they’re just getting unlucky. But one thing is for sure – these losses aren’t going to do much to help Nevada’s casinos, which are already struggling to compete with their counterparts in other states.

Most of the blame for these losses seems to be falling on the shoulders of veteran goaltender Marc-Andre Fleury. The three-time Stanley Cup champion has been nothing short of spectacular for Vegas this season, and his performance against San Jose was no exception. Fleury made 34 saves, including a number of highlight-reel stops, en route to his first overtime victory of the season.

Fleury’s play has been a big reason why Vegas has been able to overcome its lack of offensive firepower. The Golden Knights currently rank near the bottom of the league in scoring, but they continue to find ways to win games. That resilience was on full display against San Jose, as Vegas managed to come back from two separate one-goal deficits before eventually prevailing in overtime.

Thursday’s victory was also a bit of redemption for Fleury, who was pulled from last week’s game against Minnesota after allowing four goals on just 11 shots. It was only the second time in his career that he had been pulled from a game in mid-game.

Vegas will look to build on its hot start when it takes on Los Angeles at home this Saturday night.
