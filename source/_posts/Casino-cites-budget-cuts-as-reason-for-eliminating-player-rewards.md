#  Casino cites budget cuts as reason for eliminating player rewards

Casino executives say that the decision to eliminate player rewards was based on budgetary concerns, with casino profits down in recent years. But some experts suggest that the real reason for the change may be to discourage players from gambling at the casino.

The casino eliminated its loyalty program, which gave players perks like free meals and hotel stays, as well as discounts on other services. The move was announced earlier this month and went into effect immediately.

Executives at the casino said that the decision was based purely on financial considerations, with profits down due in part to competition from new casinos in the area. But others say that the elimination of rewards is a clear signal to players that they are no longer welcome at the casino.

“This is absolutely a message to players that they are no longer valued, and it’s going to have a significant impact on business,” said one gaming expert.

The casino has seen its profits decline in recent years, as it has been forced to compete with new casinos in the area. But observers say that the move away from player rewards is likely to have a negative impact on business, as players are likely to take their business elsewhere.

#  Casino blames Congress for gambling cutbacks

Casino officials are blaming Congress for cuts in gambling that have led to layoffs and closures at many of the establishments around the country.

According to a report from The Associated Press, casino operators say that a Supreme Court ruling earlier this year that struck down a federal law restricting sports betting has led to a decrease in revenue from other forms of gambling. That’s because many people have shifted their spending to sports betting, which is now legal in several states.

As a result, casinos have been forced to lay off employees and close venues. In Atlantic City, New Jersey, for example, five of the twelve casinos have closed in the past two years.

Casino officials say they hope Congress will take action to help mitigate the losses. They are asking for a subsidy or for lawmakers to reverse the ban on online gambling that was put into place in 2006.

So far there has been no indication that Congress plans to act on the matter.

#  Casino announces plans to reduce promotional spending by 50 percent

The management of Casino, a leading provider of online casino games, has announced plans to reduce promotional spending by 50 percent in an attempt to improve profitability.

The decision comes as a result of the challenging economic conditions the company is facing, which have negatively affected its revenue growth. In a statement, the company's CEO said:

"We recognise that we need to make some changes in order to protect our profitability and ensure we are well placed to take advantage of any opportunities that may come our way."

The announcement was welcomed by investors, with the company's stock prices rising by over 4 percent on the news. However, it remains to be seen whether the move will be enough to turn around Casino's fortunes.

#  Casino executives discuss impact of gambling cutbacks on business

Casino executives are coming to grips with the reality that gambling restrictions in some parts of the United States are having a significant impact on their business.

Atlantic City, New Jersey, was once the East Coast's casino gambling mecca. But those days are gone. The city has seen four of its 12 casinos close in recent years due to competition from other states with less restrictive gambling laws.

In Pennsylvania, where casinos can offer games such as blackjack and poker, casino revenue has dropped for six straight months. The state is now considering loosening its restrictions.

The situation is similar in Illinois, where lawmakers are looking at ways to boost gambling revenue to help address the state's massive financial problems. One proposal would allow slot machines at race tracks.

"The fact that money is leaving these states and going to other states where gaming is more available is definitely a concern," said Jane Weinman, a spokeswoman for the American Gaming Association. "It's something we're watching closely."

Gambling industry analysts say the trend could have a chilling effect on casino development in other parts of the country.

#  Customers express disappointment over gambling cutbacks at casino

Hundreds of casino customers in Atlantic City expressed disappointment Saturday over recent cutbacks in gambling hours at the 12 casinos there.

The casinos now close at 4 a.m., instead of 5 a.m., because of the state budget crisis. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie ordered the cuts as he tries to fill a $2.7 billion budget gap.

"It's ridiculous," said Ralph Mahood, 56, of Union Township, Cumberland County, who was at the Borgata casino in Atlantic City on Saturday morning. "They're nickel-and-diming us to death."

Mahood said he has been coming to Atlantic City for years and never encountered such problems. He said he planned to spend about $500 on slot machines during his visit this weekend and would now likely spend only $250.

At Caesars Atlantic City, customer Jeanine Saccoccio, 55, of Brick Township, Ocean County, also was angry about the hour cutbacks.
Saccoccio said she comes to the casino about twice a month and typically spends about $200 each time. With the shorter hours, she said she will now only come once a month and spend only $100. 
"It's really going to put a damper on things," she said. "It's not right."

But some casino customers said they don't mind the shorter hours because it will mean less congestion on the gambling floors and more availability of machines and tables. 
"I'm all for it," said Rosemarie DiPietro, 73, of Howell Township in Monmouth County. "I don't like it when it's too crowded." 
She said that with the earlier closing times, "I'll be able to get a machine more easily and I'll be able to play longer."
