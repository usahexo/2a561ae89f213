#  Minnesota Timberwolves Complete Successful Round Robin

With a 111-109 victory over the Oklahoma City Thunder on Sunday, the Minnesota Timberwolves completed their 4-0 round robin preseason schedule. This is the first time the Timberwolves have ever achieved a perfect preseason record.

The Timberwolves were led by Karl-Anthony Towns and Jimmy Butler, who each scored 21 points. Andrew Wiggins contributed 18 points, and Jamal Crawford came off the bench to score 15 points.

"I'm really proud of our team," said head coach Tom Thibodeau. "This is a great way to start the season."

The Timberwolves open their regular season on Wednesday night against the San Antonio Spurs.

#  Timberwolves Complete Perfect Round Robin

The Minnesota Timberwolves have completed the perfect round robin. With a 114-110 victory over the Denver Nuggets, the Timberwolves finished the season at 16-0 in games against divisional opponents.

It was a close game throughout, with the Timberwolves leading by just two points heading into the final quarter. However, they were able to pull away down the stretch and secure the victory.

Karl-Anthony Towns led the way for Minnesota, scoring 36 points and grabbing 19 rebounds. Jimmy Butler chipped in with 23 points, while Andrew Wiggins added 19 points of his own.

With the victory, the Timberwolves clinched home court advantage throughout the playoffs. They will now await their first round opponent, which will be either the Utah Jazz or Oklahoma City Thunder.

#  Minnesota Completes Unblemished Round Robin

The Minnesota Lynx completed an unblemished round robin with a 77-64 victory over the Phoenix Mercury on Sunday.

It was anything but easy, however, as the Lynx had to mount a fourth-quarter comeback to pick up the win.

Phoenix led by as many as eight points in the fourth quarter, but Minnesota used a 13-3 run to take control of the game. Maya Moore led the way for the Lynx, scoring 27 points on 11-of-19 shooting. Seimone Augustus added 18 points, and Rebekkah Brunson grabbed 10 rebounds.

Minnesota is now 12-0 on the season and will take on the Seattle Storm in the first round of the playoffs.

#  Timberwolves Post Perfect Record in Round Robin Play

The Minnesota Timberwolves have completed their round robin schedule undefeated, with a perfect 8-0 record. This accomplishment is even more impressive when you consider that the teamâ€™s best player, Jimmy Butler, has only been playing in 3 of those games.

Coach Tom Thibodeau has been able to get contributions from a number of different players, including Jeff Teague, Karl-Anthony Towns and Andrew Wiggins. In particular, Wiggins seems to have taken a step forward this year, averaging over 23 points per game.

The Timberwolves now await the results of the other conferences to see who they will play in the first round of the playoffs. With as much momentum as they currently have, they will be a difficult opponent for anyone.

#  Minnesota Goes 5-0 in Round Robin Play

Minnesota capped off an undefeated round robin campaign at the Pond Hockey Tournament in St. Paul with a thrilling 3-2 victory over Michigan in the championship game.

The Gophers were led by tournament MVP Kyle Rau, who scored two goals in the final, including the game-winner with just 2:34 remaining.

Nick Bjugstad and Nate Condon also found the back of the net for Minnesota, while goalie Adam Wilcox made 24 saves on 26 shots to secure the win.

With the victory, Minnesota becomes just the second team ever (joining Colorado College in 2009) to go 5-0 in round-robin play at the prestigious tournament.
