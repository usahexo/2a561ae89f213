#  Oklahoma City Thunder win big, parlay payouts increase!

The Oklahoma City Thunder have been on a tear lately and it doesn’t look like they are going to stop anytime soon. As a result, the payouts for betting on the Thunder to win have increased significantly.

For example, at one Las Vegas casino, if you bet $100 on the Thunder to win, you would now receive $175 back if they pull off the upset. That’s a 75% payout!

Betting on the Thunder has also become more popular in recent days. This is likely due to the fact that they have one of the best players in the league in Russell Westbrook. Westbrook is having an MVP-type season and is driving his team towards an NBA championship.

If you are looking to place a bet on the Thunder, be sure to do so soon. The odds are likely to keep increasing as they continue to win games. And who knows? Maybe you could be one of the lucky people who walks away with a big payout!

#  Parlay payout boosts for Thunder fans after big win!

Oklahoma City Thunder fans are celebrating today after the team’s big win against the Golden State Warriors. Not only does this mean that their team is one step closer to making it to the playoffs, but it also means that they’ll be receiving a bonus payout thanks to their parlay bets!

If you placed a bet on the Thunder to win AND they covered the point spread, then your payout is automatically boosted by 5%. This means that if you placed a $100 bet and they won by more than 5 points, then you would receive an extra $5 payout, for a total of $105.

Not only that, but if you placed a bet on the Thunder to win ATS (against the spread), and they lost by less than 5 points, then your payout is automatically doubled! So if you placed a $100 bet and they lost by 4 points or less, you would receive a payout of $200.

Of course, these bonuses are in addition to any regular payouts you may have already received. So whether your team wins or loses, make sure to take advantage of these fantastic parlay payouts!

#  Parlay increases for Oklahoma City Thunder fans!

The Oklahoma City Thunder had an excellent season and they were rewarded with a better than expected playoff position. With the Golden State Warriors sweeping the Portland Trail Blazers, the Thunder now find themselves as the underdog in their matchup against the defending champions.

Despite being underdogs, the Thunder have a real chance at upsetting the Warriors. The key to this upset will be their ability to parlay their strengths into victories.

The Thunder's biggest strengths are their athleticism and length. They will need to use these advantages to create turnovers and get out in transition. When they are able to run, they are one of the most dangerous teams in the league.

Russell Westbrook is also a huge factor for the Thunder. He is one of the most dynamic players in the NBA and he can take over a game at any time. If he is able to get going, it will be difficult for the Warriors to stop him.

While Oklahoma City does have some strengths, they also have some weaknesses. The biggest weakness for the Thunder is their lack of shooting. This was evident in their last matchup against the Warriors, where they only scored 88 points on 34% shooting from the field.

If Oklahoma City wants to win, they will need to shoot better offensively. They can do this by taking better shots and by getting more shooters involved in the offense. Steven Adams and Domantas Sabonis need to be more aggressive in scoring inside, while Andre Roberson and Terrance Ferguson need to knock down some open shots from beyond the arc.

If Oklahoma City can use their athleticism and length to create turnovers and get out in transition, while also shooting better offensively, they will have a good chance at upsetting the Warriors.

#  Parlay betting increased after Oklahoma City Thunder's big victory over the Lakers! 

In the aftermath of the Oklahoma City Thunder's 114-108 victory over the Lakers, NBA parlay betting saw a significant increase. This is likely due to the big upset win by the Thunder and the potential payout for anyone who correctly guessed all six results.

The Lakers were favored heading into this game, but Oklahoma City proved that they are a force to be reckoned with. Paul George led the way for the Thunder with 36 points, while LeBron James had an impressive triple-double for the Lakers with 29 points, 17 rebounds, and 10 assists.

This victory was a big one for Oklahoma City and should give them some much-needed momentum as they enter into the rest of the season. The Lakers, on the other hand, will need to figure out what went wrong in order to get back on track.

For those who bet on the NBA, this game was a roller coaster. The Thunder opened up as 7.5-point underdogs and managed to pull off the upset win. This is sure to lead to a surge in parlay betting in coming days and weeks as people try to replicate Oklahoma City's success.

#  Biggest winner of the night? The parlay bettors who backed the Oklahoma City Thunder!

Going into game 4 of the Western Conference Finals, the Oklahoma City Thunder were a -350 favorite to win the game and advance to the NBA Finals. The Golden State Warriors were a +290 underdog. Smart basketball fans who parlayed those two bets together would have walked away with a nice payday on Tuesday night.

The Thunder did indeed win game 4 by a score of 108-101, sending the series back to Oakland for Game 5 on Thursday night. That means the parlay bettors who backed Oklahoma City are now 3-1 in this series, and stand to make a lot of money if the Thunder can pull off the upset and beat Golden State in Game 7 (or 6, if it happens sooner).

If you didn’t put any money down on this parlay, it’s not too late to do so! The odds will be shorter than they were before Tuesday night’s game, but they should still be juicy enough that you can make a nice profit by betting on them.

There are plenty of other opportunities to make money on this series as well. For example, the Warriors are currently -8 favorites in Game 5, so there is value to be had by betting against them. Alternatively, you could take advantage of the inflated odds and bet on the Thundermoneyline in order to make even more money.

 whichever route you decide to go, make sure you tune in for Game 5 of the Western Conference Finals on Thursday night!
