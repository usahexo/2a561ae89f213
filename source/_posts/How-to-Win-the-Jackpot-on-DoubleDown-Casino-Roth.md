#  How to Win the Jackpot on DoubleDown Casino Roth

There are numerous strategies for playing casino games. Some people like to use systems, others bet on hunches. However, there is one approach that is guaranteed to work every time – doubling down on blackjack hands.

To take advantage of this strategy, players first need to understand how it works. Doubling down allows players to double their bet and receive just one more card. This can be a powerful tool when used correctly, as it allows players to increase their chances of winning while also risking less money.

When it comes to blackjack, doubling down is particularly advantageous because the player always has the option of standing or hitting, even if they have already doubled down. This means that they can still improve their hand if they receive a good card.

Players should keep in mind, however, that doubling down always increases the risk of losing money. They should only use this tactic if they feel confident in their hand and are willing to risk more money in order to win larger payouts.

With these tips in mind, players can start using the doubling down strategy at DoubleDown Casino Roth and start racking up the jackpots!

II. Playing the Game 
A. Place Your Bets 
1. Select the chip denomination you want to use by clicking the chip buttons at the bottom of the screen. (You can also use the keyboard shortcuts: 1-5 for low denominations, 6-10 for medium, and 11-25 for high.) 
2. Click on the area of the table where you would like to bet. A colored chip will appear in that spot and your bet amount will be displayed in the betting box above your chosen chips. You can also drag your chips around on the table to place them wherever you like. If you change your mind about a bet, just click on it again to deselect it. 
3. To place a side bet, click on one of the six areas marked SIDE BET at the sides of the tableau and then select the chip denomination you want to use by clicking on one of the buttons at the bottom of the screen or using one of the keyboard shortcuts (1-5 for low denominations, 6-10 for medium, and 11-25 for high). The amount of your side bet will be displayed in bold next to each side bet spot as well as in parentheses in the betting area at top center of your game screen while you are playing (e.g., "(5) Two Way Royal"). The six side bets are described later in this document under "III. Side Bets."
4. Clicking on Deal will deal two cards face up to each player and two cards face down to dealer, starting with player closest to dealer's left (The first card dealt face down to a player is called their "hole card"). Dealer will always draw one more card than each player, regardless of any Blackjack rules that may be in effect . Bets are not accepted after cards have been dealt . In order for players to remain competitive throughout an entire shoe (eight decks), we offer a Double Down On First Hand bonus opportunity – details are described under "IV Bonus Opportunities."
5. If you have a total card value that is closer to 21 than dealer's total card value, or if your first two cards equal 21 ("blackjack"), then you win! Your chips will be automatically paid out according from 1:1 up to 3:2 depending on which variety of blackjack game you are playing, unless you have doubled down which changes these ratios (see below). Winning hands automatically surrender any Insurance bets .

B. Blackjack Rules - Dealer Hits Soft 17 
1) When dealer has an Ace showing and any other number valued card (2-6), he must hit – even if he has 17 points formed already (example: Ace + 5 = 16). If dealer has an Ace showing and any 7 or higher valued card , he must stand . An Ace+6 equals either 7 or 17 so dealer hits in both situations . Soft 17s comprise over 30% percent of all hands dealt , so dealers now hit soft 17s under nearly all conditions . This rule change impacts basic strategy decisions when playing double deck games – making doubling down more attractive under certain circumstances . Players using basic strategy when playing games with four or more decks would not be affected unduly by this rule change . 2) For games dealt from a shoe , including those using six decks , dealers stand on all 17s . 3) Splitting pairs : When players are dealt two cards of equal rank (e.g., two kings), they may split them into two separate hands by placing an additional bet equal to their original wager beside their first two cards – separated by a betting box mark . The dealer then deals another card face up to each hand resulting from splitting pairs except Aces which only receive one additional card according to regular blackjack rules as noted above . Players may double down after splitting pairs unless doubling down is prohibited due to having less than ten points total – see chart below: Doubling Down After Splitting Pairs Rule Chart 

If both original cards are 10-point totals (or court cards), player can't split or double; else normal splitting & doubling rules apply 4) Multiple splits : Each time players split pairs they create two new hands that are treated separately for all subsequent betting purposes including splitting again should further identical pairs appear . 5) Late Surrender : A player may choose late surrender if their first two cards total 16 or less points AND THE DEALER HAS AN Ace UP (* see note below tables ). 6) Re-splitting pairs : After receiving an initial split hand, players may re-split identical pairs once again
