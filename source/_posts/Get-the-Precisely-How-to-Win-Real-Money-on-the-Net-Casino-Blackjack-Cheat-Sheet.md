#  Get the Precisely How to Win Real Money on the Net Casino Blackjack Cheat Sheet

The simplicity of blackjack is one reason this casino game is so popular. The goal is to achieve a total card value that’s greater than the dealer, but not too much greater or you will bust. Players use skill and strategy to accomplish this, making it a game that can be won with enough practice.

But what if you don’t have time for practice? Or maybe you just want to jump right in and start winning some real money?

In that case, you need a blackjack cheat sheet. This guide will show you the best way to win at blackjack so you can start padding your bank account.

First, we’ll look at the basic rules of the game.

# The Basic Rules of Blackjack

Before getting into strategies for how to win at blackjack, let’s take a quick look at the basic rules. This will help you understand what we are trying to accomplish when we talk about winning strategies.

In blackjack, each player is dealt two cards face up. The dealer also receives two cards, but one is face down and one is face up. The face-up card is used to determine whether the dealer has a “natural” (an ace and a 10-point card), in which case the hand ends and no one wins or loses money. If the dealer does not have a natural, then players can continue taking additional cards in an attempt to get as close to 21 as possible without going over (this is called “busting”). The player with the highest total card value (not counting any bonuses for special hands) wins the hand. If both players have the same total card value, then it is a tie or “pushing” hand.

# Winning Strategies for Blackjack

Now that you know the basic rules of blackjack, let’s take a look at some winning strategies. Note that not all of these will work every time – like in any other casino game, blackjack involves some amount of luck – but using them should give you a better chance of winning than going in blind.

# 1: Know When to Stand pat (or Hit)

The most important decision you make in blackjack is when to stop taking additional cards (called “hitting”). If you go over 21, you bust and lose the hand no matter what else happens. So it’s important to know when it’s safe to stand pat (or hit) depending on your current hand total and the dealer’s upcard. You can find detailed charts listing when to hit or stand pat online, but here are some general guidelines:



	 	 	If your two cards add up to 12 or less, always hit . Even if the dealer has an Ace up, it’s still better to risk another card in hopes of getting closer to 21 than hold on to your current total and hope for the best .



	 	 	If your two cards add up to 13-16, hit only if the dealer has a 2 through 6 showing . An Ace plus any 7 or 8 forces you to stand pat , since there’s now a good chance that the dealer will bust with any additional cards .



	 	 	If your two cards add up to 17-21, stand pat unless the dealer has an Ace showing . In that case , hit unless you have an 18 or higher total .

Basics
Blackjack is a casino game between a player and dealer. The aim of the game is to get cards totalling 21 or as close to 21 as possible, without going over. Face cards are worth 10 points each, while other cards are worth their number value. Aces can be counted as 1 or 11 points.

The player begins by placing a bet on the table, and then receives two cards face up. The dealer also receives two cards, one face up and one face down. Players must decide whether to ‘hit’ (take another card), ‘stand’ (end their turn), ‘double down’ (double their bet and receive one more card), or ‘split’ (split their hand into two separate hands). Hitting means taking another card, while standing means not taking any more cards. Doubling down means the player bets double their original bet and takes one more card. Splitting means the player splits their hand into two separate hands, and plays each hand independently. After all players have finished their turns, the dealer flips over their hidden card and reveals whether they have gone bust (exceeded 21 points). If the dealer has bust, then all players who have not busted win automatically. If the dealer has not busted, then the highest scoring hand wins – either the player or dealer, depending on who has the highest total score.

In blackjack, you can win by having a higher score than the dealer without going over 21, or by having Blackjack (an Ace and a ten-value card). If you go over 21 points then you automatically lose, regardless of what the dealer has.

The strategy for playing blackjack is to make decisions that give you the best chances of winning against whatever hand the dealer has. This cheat sheet will tell you what to do in every situation:

# The Fundamentals of Blackjack

Blackjack is a casino card game that pits player against dealer. The goal is to beat the dealer’s hand using as few cards as possible, without going over 21. The game is played with one or more decks of 52 cards each. Face cards (Jacks, Queens, Kings) are worth 10 points, and an Ace may be worth 1 or 11 points. All other cards are worth their face value.

To begin, players place a bet in the betting area in front of them. After all bets are placed, the dealer deals two cards face-up to each player and two cards face-down to themselves. One of the dealer’s face-down cards is turned over-this is called the “hole card”. Players then have the option to hit (take another card) or stand (stick with what they have). When all players have either stood or busted (gone over 21), the dealer reveals their hole card and completes their hand according to a set of rules. The best hand possible is two cards valued at 21 (an Ace and a Ten, for example).
