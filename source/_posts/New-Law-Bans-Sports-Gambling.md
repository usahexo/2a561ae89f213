#  New Law Bans Sports Gambling

The Nevada state legislature has just passed a new law that bans any type of sports gambling within the state. The bill was proposed by Republican lawmakers and it was quickly approved by the state’s senate.

Governor Brian Sandoval is expected to sign the bill into law this week. There has been no comment from officials at casinos or sports books in the state, but it is likely that they are not happy about the new development.

Sports betting is a huge industry and it is estimated that Americans wager upwards of $150 billion on sporting events each year. Nevada is one of only four states where sports betting is currently legal, but that is about to change.

The new law prohibits any type of sports betting, including online betting and betting at casinos and racetracks. It also forbids the use of any devices, such as smartphones or computers, to place bets.

Proponents of the bill say that it is necessary to protect Nevadans from being taken advantage of by unscrupulous bookmakers. They argue that the ban will help to preserve the integrity of sporting events and that it will also create jobs in the state’s fledgling cannabis industry.

Opponents of the bill say that it will lead to a decline in tourism revenue and that it will cost jobs in the casino industry. They also argue that banning sports betting is unconstitutional and that it will be challenged in court.

#  Federal Ban on Sports Gambling to Remain in Place

The United States Supreme Court issued a ruling on Monday that effectively upholds the federal ban on sports gambling, avoiding a more comprehensive ruling on the issue.

Justices ruled 6-3 in favor of the federal government, siding with New Jersey in its challenge to the constitutionality of the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA). PASPA, signed into law by President George H.W. Bush in 1992, made it illegal for states to authorize sports gambling.

New Jersey had been seeking to allow sports betting at casinos and racetracks within its borders, arguing that the federal law infringed on states’ rights. The court’s ruling effectively blocks New Jersey from implementing such a plan.

Justice Samuel Alito wrote in his opinion for the majority that while PASPA “violates the fundamental constitutional guarantee of state sovereignty,” it is still constitutional because it serves the “important governmental interests” of protecting the integrity of sporting contests and preventing crime and corruption.

Writing in dissent, Justice Stephen Breyer said that PASPA “infringes both on states’ rights and individual freedoms. It does so unnecessarily. It covers an ever-growing range of sports bets with diminishing returns for the goals it seeks to achieve.”

Monday’s ruling is seen as a victory for professional sports leagues, who have argued that legalizing sports betting would create an environment ripe for match-fixing and other corruption. The NCAA likewise welcomed the decision, saying that it maintains “the fundamental values of amateurism and fairness that are so important to our athletes, coaches, schools and fans.”

While Monday’s decision allows the federal ban on sports gambling to remain in place, it could pave the way for future challenges to the law. In his opinion for the majority, Justice Alito suggested that PASPA may not pass constitutional muster if it were challenged again under a different legal framework.

#  New Jersey's Efforts to Legalize Sports Betting Rejected by Federal Court

On Monday, May 14th, the Third Circuit Court of Appeals in Philadelphia rejected New Jersey's efforts to legalize sports betting. The ruling was a victory for the NCAA and professional sports leagues, who brought the case against the state of New Jersey.

Lawmakers in New Jersey have been trying to legalize sports betting since 2011, after the state lost a similar case in front of the U.S. Supreme Court. In that case, the court ruled that the federal ban on sports betting, known as the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA), was constitutional.

Since then, New Jersey has tried a variety of methods to get around PASPA, including amending state law to allow sports betting at casinos and racetracks, and later authorizing it through a referendum. However, each time the state has been sued by the NCAA and professional sports leagues, and Monday's ruling was the latest defeat in that legal battle.

In their ruling, a three-judge panel from the Third Circuit Court said that New Jersey's efforts to legalize sports betting were "in clear violation" of PASPA. The panel also ruled that legalizing sports betting would cause "irreparable harm" to the NHL, NFL, NBA, and MLB, who argued that gambling on their games would hurt fan interest and business partnerships.

New Jersey lawmakers have not yet announced whether they will appeal Monday's ruling.

#  Federal Appeals Court Upholds Ban on State-Sanctioned Sports Betting

Today, the Third Circuit Court of Appeals issued a decision upholding the constitutionality of the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA), a federal law that prohibits states from authorizing sports betting.

The plaintiffs in the case, including New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, had argued that PASPA violated the Tenth Amendment by infringing on state sovereignty. The Court rejected this argument, concluding that PASPA does not commandeer state regulatory functions but instead prohibits state action.

This is the second time that a federal appeals court has upheld PASPA; in 2014, the Fifth Circuit ruled similarly in a case brought by the State of Texas. The U.S. Supreme Court is likely to hear one or more of these cases in the coming year.

#  Casino Lobbyists Cheer as Appeals Court Keeps Sports Betting Illegal

The lobbying group for casinos is applauding a federal appeals court’s decision to uphold the ban on sports betting, calling it a “common-sense victory for law enforcement and American families.”

In a 2-1 decision, the Third Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that a federal law that prohibits sports betting in all but four states is constitutional. The law, known as the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA), was passed in 1992 and allows Nevada, Delaware, Montana and Oregon to offer sports betting.

Many casino lobbyists see PASPA as key to protecting their businesses from competition from sports betting operations.

“This ruling affirms Congress’ authority to protect Americans from the harmful consequences of gambling, including addiction, bankruptcy, and crime,” said Geoff Freeman, president and CEO of the American Gaming Association.

Opponents of PASPA say that it has led to an illegal gambling market worth an estimated $150 billion per year. They also argue that the law discriminates against states that want to offer legal sports betting.

New Jersey has been fighting to overturn PASPA for years. In 2012, the state passed a law legalizing sports betting, but the courts ruled that it was unconstitutional because it violated PASPA. New Jersey then took its case to the Supreme Court, but in 2018 the high court declined to hear it.

The Third Circuit Court’s latest decision is a blow to New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy, who had vowed to make his state the “Las Vegas of the East Coast” by legalizing sports betting. Murphy condemned Thursday’s ruling as “a loss for New Jersey and for millions of fans across our state who love rooting for their hometown teams.”
