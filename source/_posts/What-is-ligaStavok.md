#  How did Roth become part of the Phillies? 

The Phillies acquired first baseman Eric Thames from the Milwaukee Brewers in exchange for left-handed pitcher Carlos Sánchez on December 3, 2010. Thames had a .262 batting average with 12 home runs and 37 RBIs in 101 games during the 2010 season. He missed most of the 2009 season due to a torn ACL in his right knee.

To make room on the roster for Thames, the Phillies designated left-handed relief pitcher J. C. Romero for assignment. Romero was subsequently claimed off waivers by the St. Louis Cardinals on December 10, 2010.

On January 21, 2011, the Phillies traded outfielder Jonny Gomes to the Cincinnati Reds for infielder Wilson Valdez. Valdez hit .236 with 11 doubles, one home run and 17 RBIs in 97 games during the 2010 season with the Reds.

With Gomes no longer on their roster, and given that they already had Domonic Brown in their outfield organizationally, the trade of Gomes signaled that Brown was likely to be promoted to the major leagues at some point during 2011.

Roth was originally drafted by Philadelphia in 2007 but did not sign and went to play college ball at Cal State Fullerton instead. After being drafted again by Philadelphia in 2009, this time he signed and started his professional career with Single-A Lakewood BlueClaws

#  What are the expectations for the Phillies this year? 

2018 is a pivotal year for the Philadelphia Phillies. After years of rebuilding, the team is ready to make a playoff push.

Manager Gabe Kapler has set the expectations high, saying that the Phillies are expected to win the division. He believes that the team's young stars - Rhys Hoskins, Aaron Nola, and J.P. Crawford - are ready to take the next step.

The front office has been busy this offseason, adding Carlos Santana, Jake Arrieta, and Seranthony Dominguez to the roster. They believe that this team has what it takes to compete in a tough division.

The Yankees and Red Sox are once again favourites to win the division, but the Phillies should not be underestimated. With one of the strongest lineups in baseball and a rotation led by Aaron Nola and Jake Arrieta, they have a chance to make some noise in 2018.

#  What is Roth's favorite thing about playing for the Phillies? 

Mauricio Dubon has had the opportunity to interview Philadelphia Phillies shortstop Scott Kingery on a few occasions. Dubon says, "Roth's favorite thing about playing for the Phillies is the reunion every year with his friends on the team."

Kingery agrees and elaborates, "It's awesome to be able to come in every day and see all of my buddies - guys I've played with since I was drafted or in the minors. We have a great time together, both on and off the field."

The camaraderie is evident in the way they play together, with 2019 being no exception. The Phillies are cruising along at 73-48 as of August 14th, thanks in part to solid contributions from Kingery, Roth and the rest of their teammates.

#  What do you think Roth will bring to the Phillies this year?

Phillies’ fans everywhere are anxious to see what new outfielder Bryce Harper will bring to the team this year. But let’s not forget about the acquisition of J.T. Realmuto either—the Marlins catcher who was traded to Philadelphia in February. Another big question for the Phillies this season is, what will newly-signed starter Jake Arrieta bring to the mound?

Many baseball analysts are predicting that this could be a breakout year for the Phillies. The team has plenty of young talent and seems to be clicking on all cylinders heading into the 2019 season. And then there’s manager Gabe Kapler, who is still making believers out of some Philly fans after a frustrating 2018 season.

But what about the bullpen? Aaron Nola, Zach Eflin, and Nick Pivetta are all solid starters, but can the Phillies count on their relief pitchers to hold things together in the late innings? Hector Neris had a very up-and-down season last year, and it remains to be seen if he can be relied upon in high-stakes situations.

One thing is for sure: there will be plenty of excitement in Philly this year as the Phillies battle for a playoff spot!
