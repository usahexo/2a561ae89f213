After all, there are plenty of things that could go wrong when you’re putting your hard-earned money on the line. So it’s no surprise that some casinos are now offering “ghosting protection” to their players.</p>
<p>What is ghosting protection? Essentially, it’s a way for casinos to ensure that their players are never unfairly disadvantaged. If a player suspects that they are being “ghosted” – that is, someone is using software or other methods to cheat – they can raise a flag and the casino will take corrective action. This might include voiding the player’s bet, or even shutting down the game.</p>
<p>Casinos have long been aware of the potential for cheating, and have developed all sorts of methods to combat it. But with the rise of online gaming, new threats have emerged. One of these is ghosting, which can be quite difficult to detect.</p>
<p>But with ghosting protection in place, casinos can be assured that their players are always treated fairly. So if you’re looking for a truly fair gaming experience, make sure to look for casinos that offer this service!</p>
<h1 id="Ghosting-In-Online-Poker-Is-Now-A-Felony-In-Orlando"><a href="#Ghosting-In-Online-Poker-Is-Now-A-Felony-In-Orlando" class="headerlink" title="Ghosting In Online Poker Is Now A Felony In Orlando!"></a>Ghosting In Online Poker Is Now A Felony In Orlando!</h1><p>Poker players in Orlando, Florida, who “ghost” (fade) their opponents in tournaments may now find themselves facing felony charges, as reported by the Orlando Sentinel. Ghosting is the act of voluntarily leaving a poker game or tournament before all your chips are gone, thereby allowing other players to win more money by stacking the deck against them.</p>
<p>The new law defines ghosting as a third-degree felony, which could result in up to five years in prison and/or a $5,000 fine. The law was passed to help protect the rights of online poker players in the state and make sure that everyone has an equal chance of winning.</p>
<p>This new law comes on the heels of another controversial law that makes it a felony to play online poker in Florida. That law was passed in 2011 and has been widely criticized for putting poker players at a disadvantage vis-a-vis other casino games such as blackjack and craps. Critics say that the law makes it impossible for Floridians to play online poker legally, while doing nothing to prevent them from playing other casino games online.</p>
<p>Supporters of the bill say that it is necessary to protect citizens from fraud and cheating. They argue that online poker is particularly susceptible to cheating, since players can hide their identities and play from anywhere in the world.</p>
<h1 id="Magic-Announce-Plans-To-Put-An-End-To-Ghosting-Forever"><a href="#Magic-Announce-Plans-To-Put-An-End-To-Ghosting-Forever" class="headerlink" title="Magic Announce Plans To Put An End To Ghosting Forever!"></a>Magic Announce Plans To Put An End To Ghosting Forever!</h1><p>In a startling announcement made earlier today, the world’s oldest and most prestigious magic organization - Magic,Inc - declared their plans to put an end to the widespread phenomenon of ‘ghosting’ once and for all.</p>
<p>For those of you who are not familiar with the term, ghosting is when someone disappears from your life without any warning or explanation. They might stop responding to your texts, emails or calls, or just inexplicably vanish from your social media circles without so much as a ‘farewell’.</p>
<p>The problem of ghosting has been growing steadily over the past few years, as technology has made it easier for people to keep in touch with each other. With one simple swipe or click, someone can suddenly disappear from your life without any warning or explanation.</p>
<p> And while there have been countless articles and books written on the subject, no one has been able to come up with a definitive solution. Until now.</p>
<p>Magic,Inc plans to put an end to ghosting once and for all by using their unique powers to intervene directly in people’s lives. Whether it’s using telekinesis to move someone’s phone across the room so they can’t ignore your call, or using mind control to make them appear in front of you when you’re least expecting it, Magic,Inc plans to do whatever it takes to ensure that people don’t disappear on each other without a trace.</p>
<p>In a statement released earlier today, a spokesperson for Magic,Inc said: “We realize that this is a bold move, but we feel that it’s necessary in order to create a world where people can trust each other again. We’re tired of seeing people get hurt by ghosts, and we’re confident that our new approach will put an end to this senseless epidemic once and for all.”</p>
<p>So what do you think? Are you excited about Magic,Inc’s plans to put an end to ghosting forever? Or do you think that this is a violation of people’s privacy? Let us know what you think in the comments below!</p>
<h1 id="Florida-Legislature-Passes-Bill-Criminalizing-Ghosting-In-Poker"><a href="#Florida-Legislature-Passes-Bill-Criminalizing-Ghosting-In-Poker" class="headerlink" title="Florida Legislature Passes Bill Criminalizing Ghosting In Poker!"></a>Florida Legislature Passes Bill Criminalizing Ghosting In Poker!</h1><p>On Monday, the Florida Legislature passed a bill criminalizing the act of ghosting in poker. The new law, signed by Governor Ron DeSantis on Tuesday, will make it a third-degree felony to intentionally sit out a hand in order to tank the action and increase one’s chances of winning.</p>
<p>The law was proposed by Representative Cord Byrd (R), who was inspired to act after observing players at his local casino ghosting their opponents.</p>
<p>“I saw somebody sitting out a hand and realized what was happening,” Byrd said in a statement. “It’s blatant cheating and needs to be illegal.”</p>
<p>Opponents of the bill say that it’s too vague and could be open to interpretation. What constitutes intentionally sitting out a hand? Is it only intentional if you’re trying to tank the action on purpose? What if you have to go take a leak and your opponent decides to all-in?</p>
<p>“This is something that we need to tread carefully on,” Senator Randolph Bragg (D) said during debate on the bill. “We don’t want to put people in jail for accidentally sitting out a hand.”</p>
<p>Despite the concerns, the bill passed unanimously in both the House and Senate and will now become law in Florida.</p>
<h1 id="New-Anti-Ghosting-Legislation-Goes-Into-Effect-In-Florida"><a href="#New-Anti-Ghosting-Legislation-Goes-Into-Effect-In-Florida" class="headerlink" title="New Anti-Ghosting Legislation Goes Into Effect In Florida"></a>New Anti-Ghosting Legislation Goes Into Effect In Florida</h1><p>Just in time for the spookiest month of the year, new anti-ghosting legislation goes into effect in Florida. The law, which was passed in May, makes it illegal for real estate agents to sign contracts with more than one party for the same property.</p>
<p>“This is great news for homeowners and buyers in Florida,” said Governor Ron DeSantis. “Ghosting is a rampant problem in our state, and this new law will help to protect consumers from being taken advantage of.”</p>
<p>What is ghosting? Ghosting is when a real estate agent signs a contract with one party but then representation is abruptly terminated and the agent begins working with another party without any warning or formal notification. This often leaves homeowners and buyers feeling confused and frustrated.</p>
<p>Under the new law, real estate agents who engage in ghosting could face civil penalties of up to $5,000 per occurrence.</p>
<p>Governor DeSantis signed the bill into law on May 31st, 2019. It goes into effect on July 1st, 2019.</p>
